                <strong>This Website</strong><br>
                This project required me to learn several new skills that I'm not formally trained for nor
                particularly comfortable with. I already roguhly knew HTML but I have taken great strides in my
                ability to structure things as well as applying CSS.<br>
                I learned to configure an Appache server with an SSL certificate and have my domain always
                resolve to the correct IP with dynamic DNS. A bash script checks constantly for updates to the
                repo and pulls changes to the server whenever necessary. Not the most ellegant form of
                Continuous integration but an interesting experiment. <br>
                I had to take security measures to prevent inputs from being abused. Javascript was something I
                was familiar with in the context of games on HTML5 canvas but it has been a great opportunity to
                grow my experience using Javascript in a
                more useful context. <br>
                I got to use the firebase API for it's realtime database to support my multiplayer browser
                games. <br>

                <strong>Discord Moderation Bot</strong><br>
                This is the first software I made on request for a client. It is a moderation tool for tracking
                reprimands and punishments to discord users and reminding when they can be appealed or
                suggesting when to ban or kick based on accumulated warnings. I had to learn to use two APIs:
                the Discord API and the Google Sheets API. The sheets API was needed as the users wanted a human
                readable output table and I had no other means to give an easy front end at the time. Today I
                might have used SQLite as a database and gived an output on my site.

            </p>

                <strong>Space Battle Royale Game</strong><br>
                This is a 3D multiplayer game built in Unity as part of a group for a module in 3rd year. This
                taught me a lot about working in a multi-discipline envirnemont and the value of discipline
                specialisation and task prioritisation. We delivered a game which beat all other projects in the
                year with the exception of one. Mostly thanks to organised management and playing to team
                members' strengths.<br>
                I was specifically responsible for the camera controls, UI and UX, as well as integrating the
                sounds produced by our sound designer so that they were intertwined with the gameplay. <br>
                This project was the first time I used a planning board and had regular meetings with a client
                and the team. This was a decent first exposure to what I may encounter in a professional
                envirnonment
                in the future, including requirements and design documentation.
