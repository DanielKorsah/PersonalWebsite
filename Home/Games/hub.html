                A boolean logic puzzle game prototype. Developed alone as a spin-off from the Global Game Jam 2020 prompt,
                "repair". The game is themed as a PCB that needs its bits flipped such that after the given transformations
                the result matches the expected output. This prototype build was used to gather feedback on colorblind friendliness
                of various colour schemes. The game features a nice implementation of a modular node-graph system.

                A project idea supplied by my stepbrother who explained the hit and damage rules for Warhammer to me as he was
                getting into it. It takes the attacker and defender stats and number of attacks, and returns the number of
                attacks that hit and the number that wound the defender. This project was originally an Android app
                (hence the preview image's dodgy crop due to aspect ratio) but has been exported as a WebGL browser application
                for demo purposes.

                <strong>This Website</strong><br>
                This project required me to learn several new skills that I'm not formally trained for nor
                particularly comfortable with. I already roguhly knew HTML but I have taken great strides in my
                ability to structure things as well as applying CSS.<br>
                I learned to configure an Appache server with an SSL certificate and have my domain always
                resolve to the correct IP with dynamic DNS. A bash script checks constantly for updates to the
                repo and pulls changes to the server whenever necessary. Not the most ellegant form of
                Continuous integration but an interesting experiment. <br>
                I had to take security measures to prevent inputs from being abused. Javascript was something I
                was familiar with in the context of games on HTML5 canvas but it has been a great opportunity to
                grow my experience using Javascript in a
                more useful context. <br>
                I got to use the firebase API for it's realtime database to support my multiplayer browser
                games. <br>


            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Discord Moderation Bot</strong><br>
                This is the first software I made on request for a client. It is a moderation tool for tracking
                reprimands and punishments to discord users and reminding when they can be appealed or
                suggesting when to ban or kick based on accumulated warnings. I had to learn to use two APIs:
                the Discord API and the Google Sheets API. The sheets API was needed as the users wanted a human
                readable output table and I had no other means to give an easy front end at the time. Today I
                might have used SQLite as a database and gived an output on my site.

            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Space Battle Royale Game</strong><br>
                This is a 3D multiplayer game built in Unity as part of a group for a module in 3rd year. This
                taught me a lot about working in a multi-discipline envirnemont and the value of discipline
                specialisation and task prioritisation. We delivered a game which beat all other projects in the
                year with the exception of one. Mostly thanks to organised management and playing to team
                members' strengths.<br>
                I was specifically responsible for the camera controls, UI and UX, as well as integrating the
                sounds produced by our sound designer so that they were intertwined with the gameplay. <br>
                This project was the first time I used a planning board and had regular meetings with a client
                and the team. This was a decent first exposure to what I may encounter in a professional
                envirnonment
                in the future, including requirements and design documentation.
