                This is the beginnings of a full 3D maths visualiser. Currently, it supports showing all of the uses of
                dot product. Displays the projected vector for finding the magnitude of components as well as showing

                the dot product relates to angle in both radians and degrees. The arrows can be dragged freely or

                A boolean logic puzzle game prototype. Developed alone as a spin-off from the Global Game Jam 2020
                prompt,
                "repair". The game is themed as a PCB that needs its bits flipped such that after the given
                transformations
                the result matches the expected output. This prototype build was used to gather feedback on colorblind
                friendliness
                of various colour schemes. The game features a nice implementation of a modular node-graph system.

                A project idea supplied by my stepbrother who explained the hit and damage rules for Warhammer to me as
                he was
                getting into it. It takes the attacker and defender stats and number of attacks, and returns the number
                of
                attacks that hit and the number that wound the defender. This project was originally an Android app
                (hence the preview image's dodgy crop due to aspect ratio) but has been exported as a WebGL browser
                application
                for demo purposes.

                <strong>This Website</strong><br>
                This website has at times been an exercise in learning new web-based skills which have not been my primary
                focus at work or in education. It is rough around the edges, but it is a platform for exploration.<br>

                <strong>Moderation bots</strong><br>
                This is some of the first software I made on request for a client. They were moderation tools for tracking
                reprimands and punishments to discord users and reminding when they can be appealed or
                suggesting when to ban or kick based on accumulated warnings. Similar functionality was delivered for
                reddit tools with various levels of customizable settings and interfaces for users. I am not able to
                share all of them publicly at this time but some of my personal experiments in this area are public on Github.

                <strong>Space Battle Royale Game</strong><br>
                This is a 3D multiplayer game built in Unity as part of a group for a module in 3rd year. This
                taught me a lot about working in a multi-discipline environment and the value of discipline
                specialisation and task prioritisation. We delivered a game which beat all other projects in the
                year in the Computer Share sponsored group project competition, with the exception of one,
                coming joint first and winning a partial prize but losing on the tiebreaker
                to a team who presented using the presentation software they were presenting about (which was really cool).
                Our success was thanks mostly to organised management and playing to team members' strengths.<br><br>

                I was specifically responsible for the camera controls, UI functionality and usability, as well as integrating the
                sounds produced by our sound designer so that they were intertwined with the gameplay.
                This project was the first time I used a planning board and had regular meetings with a client
                and the team, tracking requirements, deliverables, design documentation, and managing client expecations.
