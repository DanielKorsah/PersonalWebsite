                        I am a 3rd year games development student at Edinburgh Napier University. It's technical
                        training rather than design so it's essentially software engineering with a focus on games
                        programming. I like to get in the guts of stuff and build on systems taht interact with
                        eachother away from the eyes of the user. As a result of this interest I've tried my
                        hand at a lot of different fields.<br><br>
                        I have a Raspberry Pi at home on which I practive Bash scripting, Discord and Reddit bots, and
                        on which I host this website. I aim to have a grounding in any for of programming but, as may be
                        evident from the website, front end is not my forte.<br><br>
                        Goal number one is to get some work putting my games specific knowledge to work but I am
                        prepared to be put to good use in other fields. I have taken measures to practive as many
                        disciplines as possible and am willing to learn more.<br><br>
                        I have significant experience in Unity, using it multiple times over the last 5 years to take
                        part in game jams and build side projects. I've used unity in a group project which was a
                        finalist, coming second, in a competition among everyone in 3rd yeasr in the school of
                        computing. I have particularly found a niche in UI and I/O which I suppose you could combine and
                        call user experience design/implimentation.

                        <strong>Student Demonstrator for Endinburgh Napier University</strong>
                        -September to November 2018.<br>
                        Aiding the program leader for games development with personal development tutor sessions for the
                        first year students. My responsibilities were to provide feedback on the lesson plan and help
                        first years to understand games
                        programming concepts withing the context of HTML5/Javascript games. Additionally many students
                        enter the year with zero programming experience so this was an opportunity to reinforce the
                        basic concepts of programming. I plan on findoing more similiar work for the academic year
                        2019/20 too.

                        Instructing on Firetech's 3D Games with Unity course. I'm responsinble for the learning and
                        safety of groups of 14-17 year olds attending camp. This includes proper use of the unity editor
                        and scripting in C# with the unity API. Games being a particular interst of mine has qualified
                        me for this work ans I have significant experience in various versions of the Unity game engine,
                        having used it for several game jams and personal projects as well as for a big multi-discipline
                        group project.

                        <strong>This Website</strong><br>
                        This project required me to learn several new skills that I'm not formally trained for nor
                        particularly comfortable with. I already roguhly knew HTML but I have taken great strides in my
                        ability to structure things as well as applying CSS.<br>
                        I learned to configure an Appache server with an SSL certificate and have my domain always
                        resolve to the correct IP with dynamic DNS. A bash script checks constantly for updates to the
                        repo and pulls changes to the server whenever necessary. <br>
                        I had to take security measures to prevent inputs from being abused. Javascript was something I
                        was familiar with in the context of games
                        on HTML5 canvas but it has been a great opportunity to grow my experience using Javascript in a
                        more useful context. <br>
                        I got to use the firebase API for it's realtime database to support my multiplayer browser
                        games. <br>

                        <strong>Discord Moderation Bot</strong><br>
                        This is the first software I made on request for a client. It is a moderation tool for tracking
                        reprimands and punishments to discord users and reminding when they can be appealed or
                        suggesting when to ban or kick based on accumulated warnings. I had to learn to use two APIs:
                        the Discord API and the Google Sheets API. The sheets API was needed as the users wanted a human
                        readable output table and I had no other means to give an easy front end at the time. Today I
                        might have used SQLite as a database and gived an output on my site.

                        <strong>Space Battle Royale Game</strong>
                        This is a 3D multiplayer game built in Unity as part of a group for a module in 3rd year. This
                        taught me a lot about working in a multi-discipline envirnemont and the value of discipline
                        specialisation and task prioritisation. We delivered a game which beat all other projects in the
                        year with the exception of one. <br>
                        I was specifically responsible for UI and UX as well as integrating the sounds produced by our
                        sound designer so that they were intertwined with the gamepolay. <br>
                        This project was the first time I used a planning board and had regular meetings with a client
                        and the team. This was a great exposure to what I may encounter in a professional envirnonment
                        in the future.
