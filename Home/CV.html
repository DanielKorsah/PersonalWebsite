                        I am a 4th year games development student at Edinburgh Napier University. It's technical
                        training rather than design so it's essentially software engineering with a focus on games
                        programming. I like to get in the guts of stuff and build on systems that interact with
                        eachother away from the eyes of the user. As a result of this interest I've tried my
                        hand in a lot of different fields.<br><br>
                        I have a Raspberry Pi at home on which I practice Bash scripting, Discord and Reddit bots.
                        Additionally it hosts this website and web games. I aim to have a solid grounding
                        in many fields of programming but, as may be evident from the website, front end is not my
                        forte.<br><br>
                        Goal number one is to get some work putting my games specific knowledge to work but I am
                        prepared to be put to good use in other fields. I have taken measures to practice as many
                        disciplines as possible and am willing to learn more.<br><br>
                        I have significant experience in Unity, using it multiple times over the last 6 years to take
                        part in game jams and build side projects. I've used Unity on an ambitious collaborative group
                        project
                        which was a finalist, coming second, in a competition among everyone in 3rd year in the school
                        of computing. I have particularly found a niche in UI and I/O which I suppose you could combine
                        and call user experience design/implimentation. I've used this experience to aid less
                        experienced students via workshops and as an assistant organiser for the Edinburgh Global Game
                        Jam site.

                        -September 2018 to Present.<br>
                        Development and presentation of Unity Engine workshops for games students in advance of Global
                        Game Jam. I made slides and example code as well as personal help and coaching of students.
                        My work includes aiding the program leader for games development with personal development tutor
                        sessions for the first year students. My responsibilities were to provide feedback on the lesson
                        plan and help
                        first years to understand games programming concepts within the context of HTML5/Javascript
                        games. Additionally many students enter the year with zero programming experience so this was an
                        opportunity to reinforce the
                        basic concepts of programming.<br>
                        I helped as an organiser at the Edinburgh Global Game Jam site, staying on location for 2 nights
                        to keep the coffee machine and
                        snacks for jammers ticking over as well as helping some of the more inexperienced jammers with
                        their games. I'm credited on at least 3 games that I helped with.

                        <strong>This Website</strong><br>
                        This project required me to learn several new skills that I'm not formally trained for nor
                        particularly comfortable with. I already roguhly knew HTML but I have taken great strides in my
                        ability to structure things as well as applying CSS.<br>
                        I learned to configure an Appache server with an SSL certificate and have my domain always
                        resolve to the correct IP with dynamic DNS. A bash script checks constantly for updates to the
                        repo and pulls changes to the server whenever necessary. Not the most ellegant form of
                        Continuous integration but an interesting experiment. <br>
                        I had to take security measures to prevent inputs from being abused. Javascript was something I
                        was familiar with in the context of games on HTML5 canvas but it has been a great opportunity to
                        grow my experience using Javascript in a
                        more useful context. <br>
                        I got to use the firebase API for it's realtime database to support my multiplayer browser
                        games. <br>


                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Discord Moderation Bot</strong><br>
                        This is the first software I made on request for a client. It is a moderation tool for tracking
                        reprimands and punishments to discord users and reminding when they can be appealed or
                        suggesting when to ban or kick based on accumulated warnings. I had to learn to use two APIs:
                        the Discord API and the Google Sheets API. The sheets API was needed as the users wanted a human
                        readable output table and I had no other means to give an easy front end at the time. Today I
                        might have used SQLite as a database and gived an output on my site.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Space Battle Royale Game</strong><br>
                        This is a 3D multiplayer game built in Unity as part of a group for a module in 3rd year. This
                        taught me a lot about working in a multi-discipline envirnemont and the value of discipline
                        specialisation and task prioritisation. We delivered a game which beat all other projects in the
                        year with the exception of one. Mostly thanks to organised management and playing to team
                        members' strengths.<br>
                        I was specifically responsible for the camera controls, UI and UX, as well as integrating the
                        sounds produced by our sound designer so that they were intertwined with the gameplay. <br>
                        This project was the first time I used a planning board and had regular meetings with a client
                        and the team. This was a decent first exposure to what I may encounter in a professional
                        envirnonment
                        in the future, including requirements and design documentation.
